    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crème brûlée is a classic French dessert known for its rich, creamy custard base topped with a thin, crisp layer of caramelized sugar. Typically made with heavy cream, egg yolks, vanilla, and sugar, it is baked slowly in a water bath for a smooth texture. The highlight of the dessert is the caramelized topping, created by sprinkling sugar on the surface and torching it until it forms a golden, glassy crust. Served chilled, it offers a delightful contrast between the cool, velvety custard and the warm, brittle sugar shell.</p>
